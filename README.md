# AWS CloudFront + S3 Static Website Hosting

This project showcases how I hosted a **static website** using **Amazon S3** for storage and **Amazon CloudFront** as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
It demonstrates **secure, cost-optimized deployment** using AWS Free Tier without purchasing a domain.

---

## üåê Project Overview

The goal was to deploy a portfolio website with global availability, caching, and restricted S3 access.  
I faced challenges with CloudFront and S3 static website endpoints, but solved them while learning best practices for AWS deployments.

## üöÄ Architecture

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì stores the website file (`index.html`).  
- **CloudFront Distribution** ‚Äì delivers content globally with HTTPS.  
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)** ‚Äì restricts direct S3 access.  
- **Cost Optimized** ‚Äì no domain purchased, no SSL certificate requested, AWS Free Tier used.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Website Content
Developed a single-page HTML website (`index.html`) with CSS styling and optional JavaScript.

)

### Step 2: Create S3 Bucket
Created an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting with `index.html` as the root object.

### Step 3: Upload Website Files
Uploaded the website file to the S3 bucket and verified proper organization.

### Step 4: Set Up CloudFront
Created a CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket with recommended cache settings.

### Step 5: Set Up Origin Access Control (OAC)
Configured OAC so CloudFront could securely fetch files while blocking direct S3 public access.

### Step 6: Domain Registration (Optional)
Skipped purchasing a domain to stay cost-efficient; used the default CloudFront URL.

### Step 7: Provision SSL Certificate (Optional)
Did not request SSL since no custom domain was used.

### Step 8: Configure WAF Protection (Optional)
Skipped AWS WAF for cost optimization.  

### Step 9: Set Up DNS Records (Optional)
Skipped since no custom domain; CloudFront URL used for live access.

## üîß Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Initially used **S3 Static Website endpoint** ‚Üí received `403 AccessDenied`.  
- Solution: switched to **regular S3 bucket endpoint** in CloudFront, which solved the issue.  
- Learned best practices for **CloudFront + S3 integration** and troubleshooting AWS access policies.  

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

- **No domain purchased** ‚Äì used CloudFront default URL.  
- **No SSL certificate requested** from AWS Certificate Manager.  
- Leveraged **AWS Free Tier** (S3 + CloudFront) for hosting.
