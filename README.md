# AWS CloudFront + S3 Static Website Hosting

This project showcases how I hosted a **static website** using **Amazon S3** for storage and **Amazon CloudFront** as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
It demonstrates **secure, cost-optimized deployment** using AWS Free Tier without purchasing a domain.

---

## üåê Project Overview

The goal was to deploy a portfolio website with global availability, caching, and restricted S3 access.  
I faced challenges with CloudFront and S3 static website endpoints, but solved them while learning best practices for AWS deployments.

---

## üöÄ Architecture

- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì stores the website file (`index.html`).  
- **CloudFront Distribution** ‚Äì delivers content globally with HTTPS.  
- **Origin Access Control (OAC)** ‚Äì restricts direct S3 access.  
- **Cost Optimized** ‚Äì no domain purchased, no SSL certificate requested, AWS Free Tier used.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Website Content
Developed a single-page HTML website (`index.html`) with CSS styling and optional JavaScript.

### Step 2: Create S3 Bucket
Created an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting with `index.html` as the root object.

### Step 3: Upload Website Files
Uploaded the website file to the S3 bucket and verified proper organization.

### Step 4: CloudFront Setup & Troubleshooting
- Initially tried **S3 static website hosting**, which caused `403 AccessDenied` errors with CloudFront.  

**Screenshot ‚Äì S3 bucket with static website enabled:**

- **Solution:** Disabled static website hosting and used the **regular S3 bucket endpoint**, resolving the access issue.

- Created CloudFront distribution pointing to the S3 bucket with recommended cache settings.
  
- **Screenshot ‚Äì CloudFront distribution created:**

### Step 5: Set Up Origin Access Control (OAC)
Configured OAC so CloudFront could securely fetch files while blocking direct S3 public access.

### Step 6‚Äì9: Optional Configurations (Skipped for Cost Optimization)
To keep the deployment cost-optimized, these configurations were skipped in this project.  
However, they can be added later for enhanced security, scalability, and professionalism:

- **Custom Domain Registration** ‚Äì Map the CloudFront distribution to a custom domain using Route 53 or another DNS provider.  
- **SSL Certificate (ACM)** ‚Äì Request and attach an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS with a custom domain.  
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** ‚Äì Add a WAF to protect the application from common web exploits.  
- **DNS Records** ‚Äì Configure Route 53 or another DNS provider to point the domain to the CloudFront distribution.

## üîß Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Initially used **S3 Static Website endpoint** ‚Üí received `403 AccessDenied`.  
- Solution: switched to **regular S3 bucket endpoint** in CloudFront, which solved the issue.  
- Learned best practices for **CloudFront + S3 integration** and troubleshooting AWS access policies.  

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

- **No domain purchased** ‚Äì used CloudFront default URL.  
- **No SSL certificate requested** from AWS Certificate Manager.  
- Leveraged **AWS Free Tier** (S3 + CloudFront) for hosting.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

While the current deployment is cost-optimized and functional, there are additional features that could be implemented to further improve security and scalability:

- **Custom Domain Integration** ‚Äì Map the CloudFront distribution to a custom domain using Route 53 or another DNS provider.  
- **SSL Certificate** ‚Äì Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to enable HTTPS with a custom domain for secure communication.  
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** ‚Äì Protect the application from common web exploits and add an extra layer of security.
